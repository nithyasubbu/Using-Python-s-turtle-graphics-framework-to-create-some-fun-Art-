Python's Turtle graphics framework - for custom Art creation :)

(Wiki)
Turtle graphics is a computer vector graphic framework for creating custom art using a cursor ("turtle") on a cartesian plane.
It is a key feature of the "Logo" programmaing language

(Wiki - Overview)
The turtle has three attributes: a location, an orientation (or direction), and a pen. The pen, too, has attributes: color, width, and on/off state.

The turtle moves with commands that are relative to its own position, such as "move forward 10 spaces" and "turn left 90 degrees". The pen carried by the turtle can also be controlled, by enabling it, setting its color, or setting its width. A student could understand (and predict and reason about) the turtle's motion by imagining what they would do if they were the turtle. Seymour Papert called this "body syntonic" reasoning.

A full turtle graphics system requires control flow, procedures, and recursion: many turtle drawing programs fall short. From these building blocks one can build more complex shapes like squares, triangles, circles and other composite figures. The idea of turtle graphics, for example is useful in a Lindenmayer system for generating fractals. Turtle graphics are often associated with the Logo programming language.

User Instructions:
(For the scope of this project, simple programs to create some fancy custom art are demonstrated).
circleFromSquares.py - python file which creates a circle from squares on turtle graphics drawing board. The python file has all comments to guide the user through the code implementation. To run >> (OS)python/(Windows)C:/../python circleFromSqaures.py from the terminal or commandline

drawShapes.py - python file which uses turtle framework to draw two or more shapes on the same turtle window (with a common reference point). This lets the user understand how combination of shapes is possible and this can be leveraged for more complex art work. The python file has all comments to guide the user through the code implementation. To run >> (OS)python/(Windows)C:/../python drawShapes.py from the terminal or commandline

drawSquareCircle.py - python file demonstrating the sqaure + circle drawing on the same turtle window (representing the drawing board). Here, the cursor type, pen width, pen color, speed of cursor etc are changed to show additional functionality.
The python file has all comments to guide the user through the code implementation. To run >> (OS)python/(Windows)C:/../python drawSquareCircle.py from the terminal or commandline

flowerFromTriangles.py - python file to create a nice flower (big, round center and triangle petals) and a stem from multiple triangles on the turtle window. The cursor pen size, width, color, shape, speed are changed to let the user witness the difference. The python file has all comments to guide the user through the code implementation. To run >> (OS)python/(Windows)C:/../python flowerFromTriangles.py from the terminal or commandline

initials.py - python file to draw my initials on the turtle drawing board. Since my full name is "Nithya Subramanian", initials that appears on the turtle drawing board is "N S". This is neatly demonstrated by playing around with the turtle positions, angles and movements on the cartesian plane. The python file has all comments to guide the user through the code implementation. To run >> (OS)python/(Windows)C:/../python initials.py from the terminal or commandline

multipleTurtleShapes.py - python file to present a simple menu for the user to choose any shape to draw on the turtle board.
The user then selects from square, circle, triangle and exit (if none of the avove). Once the user selects, the turtle board appears with the selected shape. Here, for easy undersatnding, the turtle boards are given different background colors, different turtle shapes, different turtle speeds and so on and so forth. Kids can be taught drawing this way (using simple programming). The python file has all comments to guide the user through the code implementation. To run >> (OS)python/(Windows)C:/../python multipleTurtleShapes.py from the terminal or commandline
